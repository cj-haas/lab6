# What the Software Does

  The code in [findcarnegie.ipynb]("https://github.com/nmcdowell00/lab6/blob/main/findcarnegie.ipynb") file allows you to query the [Carnegie Mellon Directory](https://directory.andrew.cmu.edu/). It does this by using the Python Library Selenium as a way to remotely connect to the web page and enter certain search terms that *you* will specify. Selenium uses a process called webscraping to target certain elements websites codebase(building blocks of the website) and save what is stored within them. Webscraping is a bit confusing. If you want more clarification you can watch [this video]("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct8Gxo8StBU&ab_channel=ParseHub").
  
# Installation Documentation
